# Code download and python environment setup
1. Install Python (follow instructions on https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, inside a terminal:
2. Clone the code from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/davidmurray/cycling-network-design.git`
3. Change to the cloned directory: `cd cycling-network-design`
4. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .`
5. Activate the virtual environment: `source bin/activate` (note: command may differ on Windows)
6. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Data preparation
The `code/data_preparation.py` Python script prepares the data necessary for the optimization process.

```bash
Parameters:

    --zone_polygon: Path to the GeoJSON file containing the area of the zone (required).
    --od_data: Path to the CSV file containing OD demand data (required).
    --output_directory: Path to the directory where the generated files will be saved (required).
    --local_crs: EPSG code for the local coordinate system (default: epsg:2950).
    --minimum_euclidean_distance: Minimum euclidean distance of trips to be retained (default: 1000 meters).
    --verbose: Enable verbose mode (default: False).
```

## Prerequisites
2. A polygon that defines the boundary of the area to optimize. Must be provided in GeoJSON format. An example is availble in the `examples/` folder.
1. OD demand data in csv format. Your data can have many columns, but must at the very least have the `lonorig`, `londest`, `latorig` and `latdest` columns in WGS84 coordinates. An example demand file is provided in the `examples/` folder, which defines 500 randomly generated OD lines in the given polygon. See image below for a visualisation of the polygon and OD data.

```bash

python code/data_preparation.py --zone_polygon /path/to/your/zone.geojson --od_data /path/to/your/od_data.csv --output_directory
```

Example output (with `verbose` turned on):

## Usage
This script has two main modes:
1. Hyperparameter optimization mode
2. One-off mode (or "manual" mode)

In manual mode, you must supply the values of every hyperparameter, for instance the size of the population (`--n_pop X`), crossover probability (`--cxpb Y`), the mutation probability (`--mutpb Z`), etc. If you do not provide values for all hyperparameters, defaults will be used, but optimization results will likely be terrible because genetic algorithms are highly sensible to the choice of hyperparameters.

Therefore, we recommend first using the hyperparameter optimization mode to find the optimal genetic algorithm hyperparameters for a given territory. Once this is done and the best hyperparameters are identified, you can then use these parameters in one-off mode and experiment with varying the value of time $C_time$ and the cost of an unsatified trip $C_UT$, which are the main parameters in the model. The role and impact of these parameters is explained in depth in the documentation links provided above in this README file. 

### Running in hyperparameter optimization mode mode
This mode will use the [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/) library to find the best hyperparameters for the genetic algorithm. Internally, this uses the [Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2011/file/86e8f7ab32cfd12577bc2619bc635690-Paper.pdf) sampler to suggest promising hyperparameter combinations. Note: this mode roughly involves running the genetic algorithm for ten times for each hyperparameter configuration. Since each run of the genetic algorithm can take hours of calculation even on a computing cluster, finding optimal hyperparameters with this procedure may take several days (or even weeks) of calculations. We recommend letting the script test at least 40 hyperparameter combinations. 

After activating the Python environment (generally `source bin/activate`)
```bash
python code/genetic_algorithm.py \
  --data_folder data/ \
  --output_folder output/ \
  -d \
  -a \
  --optuna_log optuna-logfile.log \
  --n_workers 1
```

Meaning of each parameter:
* `--data_folder`: folder containing input data (from the _data preparation_ step)
* `--output_folder`: folder where to save the data from all attempted trials and runs
* `-d`: Run in debug mode which will print useful debugging information to the terminal
* `-a`: Run in hyperparameter optimization mode 
* `--optuna_log`: Location where to save the Optuna logfile (will contain info about attempted trials and results)
* `--n_workers`: Number of workers to use for calculations

### Running in one-off (or "manual" mode)
This mode should be used once the hyperparameter optimization is completed and a sufficiently good hyperparameter combination has been found. Once this is the case, this mode and be used to run the genetic algorithm with different values for the model parameters.
