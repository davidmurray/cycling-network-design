## Code download and python environment setup
1. Install Python (follow instructions on https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, inside a terminal:
2. Clone the code from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/davidmurray/cycling-network-design.git`
3. Change to the cloned directory: `cd cycling-network-design`
4. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .`
5. Activate the virtual environment: `source bin/activate` (note: command may differ on Windows)
6. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data preparation
The `code/data_preparation.py` Python script prepares the data necessary for the optimization process.

```bash
Parameters:

    --zone_polygon: Path to the GeoJSON file containing the area of the zone (required).
    --od_data: Path to the CSV file containing OD demand data (required).
    --output_directory: Path to the directory where the generated files will be saved (required).
    --local_crs: EPSG code for the local coordinate system (default: epsg:2950).
    --minimum_euclidean_distance: Minimum euclidean distance of trips to be retained (default: 1000 meters).
    --verbose: Enable verbose mode (default: False).
```

### Prerequisites
1. OD demand data in csv format. Your data can have many columns, but must at the very least have the `lonorig`, `londest`, `latorig` and `latdest` columns in WGS84 coordinates.
2. A polygon that defines the boundary of the area to optimize. Must be provided in GeoJSON format. An example is availble in the `examples/` folder.


### Usage

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash

python code/data_preparation.py --zone_polygon /path/to/your/zone.geojson --od_data /path/to/your/od_data.csv --output_directory
```

Example output (with `verbose` turned on):
```bash
python code/data_preparation.py --zone_polygon test/boundary.geojson --od_data test/od_bike2018.csv --output_directory data/ --verbose
